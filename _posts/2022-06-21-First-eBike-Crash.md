# Things I learned from my first eBike crash...

___

## This was my fault and could have easily been avoided
Jumping curbs is dumb. Stay in the street, or if you HAVE to use sidewalks/paths somewhere, stick to using the handicap ramp/curb cutouts. 
#### NOTE: Don't try to jump a curb at 20mph you'll just end up fucking yourself up pretty bad when it goes wrong.

___

## Go to urgent care, the emergency room, or your doctor immediately after and let them clean the wounds/road rash for you.
Unlike you, they know what they're doing without having to Google first.

___

## Immediately go to whomever can see you first/same day and immediately clean and begin treating your wounds without waiting for an appointment another day.

Having large infected scrapes on your elbow, knee, leg, whatever can reaalllllly suck. Neosporin + hydrogen-peroxide/betadine/iodine isn't going to cut it.
Go get some real prescription strength antibiotic ointment and maybe some antibiotic pills too cause you don't want to end up with staph or MRSA, or any other type of infection that could possibly get into your blood and spread throughout your body.

Better to go get the scrapes checked and cleaned by professionals then trying to take care of it yourself, failing at it, and letting the infection get bad enough to cause complications.

Just don't risk it to try to save the copay.

Also, [Amazon](https://amazon.com) sells [self adhering wound wrap (40 count of 3in wide x 5yd long rolls)](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HC58XSK/) + [Curaid 100x non-adherent pads](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005EB9SFI/) WAYYYYY cheaper than Walgreens, CVS, or Kroger.

**Do yourself a favor and keep some of the self adhering wrap + non-stick/non-absorbent pads on hand for when you inevitably crash your bike and need to change the dressings + apply antibiotics on the schedule either urgent care, your doctor, or the emergency room gave you.**

___

## ALWAYS WEAR A HELMET

Glad I was, and that my helmet had a basic face guard on it. My head definitely hit the sidewalk and I got a bloody nose. Could have been wayyyy worse. 

#### Plus wear wrist pads and knee pads if you're smart.

___

## You only get one body. Take care of it so you can continue to enjoy eBiking for years to come.

# Again, jumping curbs at max speed, for any reason, is DUMB AS HELL. Don't do it!

___ 
# Bonus: 

## Helmet cam video of me being a dumbass (and ignoring crosswalk signals, so double dumbass on me). 

#### I should have just stayed in the street.
