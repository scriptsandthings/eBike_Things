## The Good

- Decent first bike.
- 80% assembled, just add handlebar and front wheel.
- Class II ebike
- Max speedd 19.8mph

## The Okay

- Sub $1k price shipped isn't bad for an entry level ebike, as long as you expect to replace it at some point.
- I've put 100miles on it in a week, crashed it once at 20mph jumping a curb and didn't leave a scratch on the bike. I needed antibiotics though and thank god for helmets. (elbow and knee paads next).

## The Bad

- No way to purchase compatable batteries from seller. Have to either wire a 2nd battery in parallel with the existing, or completely replace the existing battery. THE SELLER DOES NOT SELL EXTRA BATTERIES AND NEITHER DOES THE BATTERY MANUFACTURER. The battery on this TotGuard Bike is completely propriatary.
- No name controller. Can only find minimaal company information, only in chinese on sites without SSL certificates. Wiring scheme for posted anywhere controller public online.
- No name motor. Can only find minimal company information online, only in chinese on sites without SSL certificates. Wireing schema or actual specs of hub motor not posted anywhere public online.
