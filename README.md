# Things related to eBikes and eBike building/upgrading/modifications
#### Stop driving and start biking :-)

### First eBike
##### [26in 350w rear hub drive 19.8mph max speed TotGuard (generic) brand eBike from Amazon](https://gregknackstedt.com/eBike_Things/TotGuard). 

I returned this bike as it has a propriatary battery and direct replacements can't be purchased, as well as a generic controller and motor with no info about them online. Other then that, if you're happy with 19.8mph max speed and about 26 miles on a fully charged battery then the 350W 26in TotGuard is a decent 'starter' eBike.

### Second eBike (First eBike Build)

- [Refurbished eBikeling 1200w front hub motor kit](https://ebikeling.com/collections/ebikeling-ebike-refurbished-kits/products/refurbished-1200w-ebike-conversion-kits?variant=39760557539394) 
- A couple used/as-is batteries pulled from damaged scooters/eBikes prior to recycling

After returning the TotGuard, I built a bike for about 1/2 the cost of the TotGuard. Or the equivilant of filling up my car's gas tank ~7x from empty (or 3x fillups and a couple months insurance). Went as cheap as I could while still getting some additional speed and range compared to the TotGuard. The FrankeBike I built can hit just over 35 MPH and have a range of 25-30 miles on full electric/no pedal assistance. Not bad for a car replacement in my neck of the woods.

However, It's not without it's faults....
