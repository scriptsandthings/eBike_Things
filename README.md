# Things related to eBikes and eBike building/upgrading/modifications

My first eBike - [26in 350w rear hub drive 19.8mph max speed TotGuard (generic) brand eBike from Amazon](https://gregknackstedt.com/eBike_Things/TotGuard) - May return this bike as it has a propriatary battery and direct replacements can't be purchased, as well as a generic controller and motor with no info about them online. Other then that, if you're happy with 19.8mph max speed and about 26 miles on a fully charged battery then the 350W 26in TotGuard is a decent 'starter' eBike.
